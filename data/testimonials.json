One of my research works was selected for poster presentation at the 80th SEG Annual Meet, Denver, USA. SPG-NA chapter helped me grab this rare opportunity by providing me with partial funds to cover my expense towards attending the conference.\n\nThe members of SPG-NA have always been a constant source of inspiration for me in all my endeavors. From the knowledgeable guidance of Mrinal Sir to the friendly advice of Dhananjay and Abhijit Sir, all the members have constantly motivated me to pursue my works.\n\nWords can in no way describe the kind of support that I have received from the members of SPG-NA. Yet, through this testimonial, I would like to thank the SPG-NA family for being such a support.",

Financial help is always appreciated, but what was more appreciated about SPG NA are the moral enthusiasm, support, and homely environment I experienced.",
